# Project README

## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive web application built using **React** with **TypeScript** functional components. The choice of TypeScript brings strong typing to the project, enhancing code quality and understandability.

## State Management

The state management of the application is handled by **Redux/Redux Toolkit**, a predictable state container for JavaScript apps that helps write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.

## Styling

For styling, **Vanilla CSS** was used. While this approach provides complete control over styles, it can be more time-consuming compared to using a CSS framework. This was one of the challenges faced during the development process.

## Authentication

**Firebase** was used as an authentication provider. Firebase provides a full suite of authentication options and handles all login and logout functionalities, making it easier to manage user sessions.

## Redux Store and Slices

The Redux store and slices were set up to manage the application state effectively. This structure allows for efficient state updates and easier debugging.

## Routing

**React Router** was used for handling routing in the application. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a way that is consistent with single page applications.

## Responsive Design

A responsive navbar was created to ensure a seamless user experience across different device sizes. This is crucial in today's multi-device world where users access web applications from a variety of devices such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Data Source

A mockup API was used to provide the raw data for the application. This approach simulates real-world scenarios where data is usually fetched from an API. The slice was set up with **axios** ready to fetch data from an external API endpoint rather than working with static data from another file. However, due to time constraints, this setup was not fully utilized.

## Deployment

The project was uploaded to **GitHub**, a platform that fosters collaboration and version control. The web application was then hosted on **Netlify**, which offers an easy-to-use platform for deploying web projects with just a few clicks.

## Reflections and Future Improvements

Looking back, using **Next.js** with **Auth.js** might have made the development process easier. Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and generating static websites for React-based web applications. One of the main benefits of Next.js is its out-of-the-box support for **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**. This feature can significantly improve the visibility of the web application in search engine results, leading to more organic traffic.

In terms of styling, **Tailwind CSS** could be a faster alternative for new projects. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML. It makes creating stateless components easy to start with, allowing for custom styling as the project progresses.

It's important to note that the primary focus of this project was not on the user interface, but rather on demonstrating data functionalities. The UI was kept simple and straightforward, serving as a vessel for showcasing these functionalities. However, with more time and resources, the UI can be enhanced to improve the overall user experience.
